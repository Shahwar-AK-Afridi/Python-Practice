I have created file using (w) mode
Mode (w) will create a new file, if it doesnot exist
If file exists, it will overwrite the existing content
----------------------------------------
I have appended this line in file2.txt
Appends add content to the end of the file
File object keeps track of where it is, so if you write again it adds the new data to the end
